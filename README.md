Improved version of AirGradient Arduino Library for ESP8266 (Wemos D1 MINI)
=====================================================================================================

This is improved fork of official [airgradienthq/arduino](https://github.com/airgradienthq/arduino) repo this version enables Plantower PMS5003 sensor capabilities to report PM1 and PM10 measurments which are not used by AirGradient project by default.

You have to replace included AirGradient.cpp and AirGradient.h libraries in your Arduino.app Libraries directory.

Then flash included C02_PM1_PM2_PM10_SHT_OLED_WIFI.ino as new AirGradient board firmware.

AirGradient Arduino Library for ESP8266 (Wemos D1 MINI)
=====================================================================================================

Build your own low cost air quality sensor with optional display measuring PM2.5, CO2, Temperature and Humidity. 

This library makes it easy to read the sensor data from the Plantower PMS5003 PM2.5 sensor, the Senseair S8 and the SHT30/31 Temperature and Humidity sensor. Visit our DIY section for detailed build instructions and PCB layout.
