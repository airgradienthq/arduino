AirGradient Arduino Library for ESP8266 (Wemos D1 MINI)
=====================================================================================================
***WORK IN PROGRESS***

This is improved fork of official [airgradienthq/arduino](https://github.com/airgradienthq/arduino) repo which enables PMS5003 sensor capabilities to report PM1 and PM10 measurments which are not used by AirGradient project before.


Build your own low cost air quality sensor with optional display measuring PM2.5, CO2, Temperature and Humidity. 

This library makes it easy to read the sensor data from the Plantower PMS5003 PM2.5 sensor, the Senseair S8 and the SHT30/31 Temperature and Humidity sensor. Visit our DIY section for detailed build instructions and PCB layout.
